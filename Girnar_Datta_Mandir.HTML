            <p>
                Girnar is an ancient hill in Junagadh, Gujarat, India. It is one of the holiest pilgrimages for Jains, where the 22nd Tirthaṅkara, Lord Neminath attained omniscience, and later nirvana along with other five hundred and thirty three enlightened sages. This is well described in ancient texts such as Kalpa Sūtra written by acharya Bhadrabāhu and Shri Uttaradhyayana Sutra by Arya Sudharmaswami.
            </p>
            <p>
                The temple is situated atop one of the peaks of Girnar Hill, at an elevation of about 3,660 feet, making it a significant pilgrimage site for devotees and spiritual seekers. The temple is believed to be the site where Lord Dattatreya performed intense penance.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reach Lord Datta temple one has to climb nearly 9,999 steps by the path away. Girnar is a sacred place for Jains and Hindus, which attracts a large number of pilgrims. . The pilgrims climb all the steps barefoot as a belief that a person who climbs all the steps barefoot reaches Heaven.
